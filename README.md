## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned
One of the biggest things that I was genuinely curious about was how to add an `alt` text to images that are added via CSS. I came across [this site](https://www.davidmacd.com/blog/alternate-text-for-css-background-images.html) that gives some tips on how to add `alt` tags.


### Continued development

I haven't used CSS Grid in a long while, and reminds me that I need to use it more for layouts.

### Useful resources

- [Alternate text for background images](https://www.davidmacd.com/blog/alternate-text-for-css-background-images.html) - Page that outlines considerations when adding images with CSS.
